# Wu-Xing

A point-and-click interactive adventure 2D puzzle game created for my Senior project in an attempt to explore the game development process as a solo developer. 

### Game Overview

The player must help restore the balance in the universe by gathering the five elemental orbs that maintain natural order and returning them to their rightful places. The player must interact with people and things in the surroundings, and figure out what must be done in order to retrieve the orbs.

### Theme

Based on the Law of Five Elements, the elements represented in the game are wood, fire, earth, metal, and water. This system of five phases is used to describe the interactions and relationships between phenomena that could be found in nature and ourselves in which each of these elements are thought to be part of our emotional, spiritual, physical and mental make up. Each element is associated with an array of characteristics such as color, season, emotional activity, taste, environmental factor, and more. Among these elements, there exist the relations of generation and restriction; giving birth and development to one while limiting anotherâ€™s excessive growth that could cause possible harm, respectively.

### Development Platform

Unity2D was used to create this game.

### Results

Three of the intended six levels have been completed.
